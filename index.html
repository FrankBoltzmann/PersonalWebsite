<meta name="description" content="I am a video game developer, computer graphics researcher and engine/render programmer with a passion for computer games. I am a problem-solver and I excel at both technical and artistic skills, ranging over multiple disciplines such as programming, logic, calculus, physics, algebra, trigonometry, geometry, drawing, writing and music. This enables me to be flexible and bridge the gap between engineering and art found in game studios. I'm a natural leader with great organisational, prioritisation and planning skills, and the ability to remain calm under stress and motivate others." />

            <p>Following the game's acquisition and rebranding, I was brought on to lead Squad 44 as Technical Lead. The project originated from a community modding team and lacked many foundational development practices typical of industry-standard game production. I established critical infrastructure including CI/CD pipelines for both the game and its mod SDK, automated data validation systems, crash reporting workflows, and robust packaging processes for Steam distribution.

Due to limited staffing, I also stepped into the roles of project manager and product owner, coordinating an international team of part-time contractors across time zones. I introduced structured workflows using JIRA, release workflows using Perforce, implemented agile task tracking, and helped develop and maintain a strategic product roadmap aimed at improving game accessibility and expanding market reach.</p>

            <p>I joined Persistence to assess and address challenges around team motivation, communication, and delivery. I identified critical bottlenecks in alignment between the strategy and development teams and provided actionable recommendations to improve collaboration and execution. I coached both the project manager and the lead programmer, who later became CTO, on leadership, communication, and delivery practices.

Additionally, I restructured their project management systems by mapping out key epics across multiple products, breaking them down into actionable tasks, assigning ownership, and implementing sprint planning to drive accountability and engagement across the team.</p>

				Programmed the initial smart contracts for Neptune on Terra to keep leveraged yield investments 
				from being liquidating by rebalancing. Developed a unique and flexible authorization system in 
				Rust for defining auth groups and assigning them to different transactions in each contract. 
				Contributed and reviewed the development of Neptune's lending market contracts in Rust and also 
				helped set up the NodeJS infrastructure for production.

          Led the programming team of Squad towards the official release of version 1.0. 
			Planned the Squad roadmap, managed its programmers, introduced sprint planning, 
			and implemented better Perforce development pipelines. Engaged with other leads
			in the Squad team such as QA, Art, Production, and Design to ensure all goals were met.
			Implemented more realistic ragdolls and synchronization over the network, as well as mod managing. 
			Part of an elite team of programmers within the company picked to work 
			on core gameplay modules to be used when creating new games. Personally 
			worked on a team tree module to display and manage teams at different depths, 
			as well as a projectile module that used the Gameplay Ability System to 
			synchronize projectile shooting and trajectories across the network.

				<h2>Fragment-History Volumes</h2>
				<p>
					Fragment-history volumes are sparse, discretised representations of
				a 3D scene with all the fragments recorded during the rasterisation
				stage of the graphics pipeline. These structures can be used to
				reduce the geometry-processing overhead for the creation of novel
				viewpoints on current graphics hardware. A poster describing the early
				stages of the research has been <u>presented at SIGGRAPH 2015</u>.
        Besides the research output, this was a large project in which a
				framework was developed for building rendering techniques easily and
				testing their performance. This framework lets the programmer create new
				rendering stages by specification, add them to the pipeline and link framebuffers,
				textures and other resources between stages. There is a XML parser that
				constructs a scene graph and each node can be changed from within the application
				at runtime using its assigned name. If activated, the framework can
				get the performance times for each individual stage of the pipeline submitted
				and output a statistical log as well as screenshots.

				<h2>X-Sledding 3000</h2>
				<p>
					A game produced by a team of six students as part of the group
				project of the MSc in Games Programming at University of Hull. We decided
				to develop our own cross-platform engine from scratch which was
				considered too ambitious: PC and PS3 support, LUA scripting, developer
				console, physics and sound powered by bullet and fmod, our own renderer
				with Cg shader code and support for scenegraphs so that a level editor
				could be done. The theme for the game
				given to us was sled racing, but instead of making a simple racing
				game where you have sleds instead of cars, we decided to create unique
				gameplay mechanics to create a challenge and some fun. The animals
				pulling the sled need to be disciplined into following your steering,
				or else it can be very hard to control the direction of the sled. Also,
				the more you whip them, the less happy they get, which reflects on their
				speed. Their energy also decreases over time, which again reflects on
				the speed. To increase energy and morale, you can give them treats which
				in turn decrease their discipline. The trick is to balance things, but
				don't forget you are also playing a racing game! Last but not least,
				the implemented AI is very effective at controlling the animals and wins
				easily, but there are also cheats to be used in the developer console!

				<h2>Snowglobe</h2>
				<p>
					OpenGL project at University of Hull for the Real Time Graphics module
					of the MSc in Games Programming. The water reflects everything, the
					tree growth is a fractal algorithm, almost everything is bumpmapped,
					Blinn-Phong shading, spotlights, particle systems, collision of snow
					flakes and leaves, smooth camera movements (using friction) and
					seasons. The tree grows	randomly different every spring.

				<h2>Procedural Planets</h2>
				<p>
					Final dissertation project for the MSc in Games Programming at
					University of Hull. Each planet is generated using pseudo-random
					number generation and a seed number, which could be randomly generated
					to make a universe of randomized planets. This project shows effective
					use of chunked level of detail algorithms and Perlin-based ridged
					multi-fractals for the terrain elevations. It was done in OpenGL and
					the multi-level blending of textures and colors was done in GLSL using
					terrain height as a parameter. A simple atmosphere and sun effects were
					also done in GLSL using spheres as a base mesh. Collision between
					camera and planets was also implemented.
